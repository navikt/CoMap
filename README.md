**System Effects** is a research methodology to explore the 'user' or citizen 
experience of complex phenomena, drawing on soft systems, fuzzy
cognitive mapping and graph theory, aiming to capture the varied nature 
of the individual experience to enable better intervention design.

This python package provides utilities to support graph analyses of data 
within the framework of this methodology, such as graph relabelling, 
graph aggregation, graph analysis tools and tools to minimize the potential leakage 
of private information in aggregate graphs.
