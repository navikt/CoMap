Welcome to CoMap's documentation!
=================================
CoMap is a simple python-based toolkit for graph aggregration and analysis to support the 
`System Effects <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24694452.2017.1309965>`_ methodology to understand the user experience of complex systems. It is python-based and relies heavily on  
`NetworkX <https://networkx.org>`_ for the creation, manipulation and study of graph objects.

System Effects is a research metodology which aims to captures the varied nature of individual 
experiences of complex systems to enable better intervention design. Drawing on soft systems, fuzzy 
cognitive mapping and graph theory, the method focuses on which barriers and enablers exist and how these are perceived to interact in the 
system. In so doing it aims to shed light on commonalities and patterns that manifest community level, 
whilst capturing the varied nature of individual experience.

CoMap provides key utilities to support processing and analysis in projects which aim to make 
use of the System Effects methodology, in particular:

*  Graph aggregration
*  Simple extraction of key graph properties
*  A collection of plotting routines to quickly yield a collection of plots to support analysis
*  A method in support of privacy-preserving graph publishing
