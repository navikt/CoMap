Welcome to CoMap's documentation!
=================================
CoMap is a simple toolkit for graph aggregration and analysis to support the System Effects methodology to understand the user experience of complex systems.
It is python-based and relies heavily on the NetworkX package for the creation, manipulation and study of graph objects.

The System Effects is a reasearch metodology which aims to captures the varied nature of individual experience of complex systems to enable better intervention design. 
Focusing on how barriers and enablers exist and are perceived by individuals in the system and harnessing elements of graph theory, System Effects aims to shed light on commonalities and patterns that manifest 
community level, whilst capturing the varied nature of individual experience.

CoMap provides key utilities to support data analysis in projects which aim to make use of the System Effects methodology, in particular:

*  Graph aggregration
*  Simple extraction of key graph properties
*  A collection of plotting routines to quickly yield a collection of plots to support analysis
*  A method in support of privacy-preserving graph publishing
